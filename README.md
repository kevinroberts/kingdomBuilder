KingdomBuilder
==============

A testing ground for an Incremental Game (Click-based game) called *Kingdom Builder*

The project can be run in any modern browser from this [Github page](http://kevinroberts.github.io/kingdomBuilder/).

Development Notes
---------------------
The basic project scaffold was built using Steve Sanderson's Yeoman build (See https://vimeo.com/97519516 for more information).

All Less files are compiled via a Gulp compile-less task.

To build for production deployment run the Gulp *build* task which can be configured via gulpfile.js
